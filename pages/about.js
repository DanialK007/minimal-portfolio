After I finished high school in 2020 at the age of 18, I wasnâ€™t sure what I wanted to do with my life. Initially, I thought my profession would be related to business. Before delving into the world of web development and design, I worked as an English teacher.</div>
                        <div className="pb-5">As a junior web developer, I realized that I enjoyed the creative aspect of my work more, and I made a full transition into the field of design. Since then, I have worked as a freelancer on platforms like Upwork and collaborated with companies and clients on a full-time or contract basis. I am currently a Frontend Developer based in Mandalay.</div>
